This project is a student expert finder. Its goal is to help students or people in need of EECS skills connect with the students, and potentialy faculty, that have them.

Acceptance Tests -

- [ ] Given that the Faculty member has decided to add new tags to the website. When they click the update changes button then the approved tags are added and the unapproved tags are removed from the suggestions.

- [ ] Given that the Faculty member has decided to approve the bans. When they click the update changes button then the banned accounts are removed from the list of people on the site and they are not able to use the site.

- [ ] Given that other users have made accounts on the database. When I search for OSU affiliated persons Then the software should filter my search results to all individuals within my search requirements who have tagged themselves as affiliated with Oregon State University.

- [ ] User acceptance test: Given that there are other users to interact with. When I mark a users account as blocked Then the software will no longer forward any messages from their account to my email, and will display an error message to them instead.

- [ ] Given that there are users in the system marked as needing help, when I click on the tag to search for only those students, then all the student profiles in the database who are marked as in need of help will appear.

- [ ] Given that I have a system to search for other experienced students, when I click on the tag to search for only those who have graduated already, then experts are listed by only those who have graduated.

- [ ] Given that the new user has visited the site for the first time, when they create their profile then that user should be able to enter in all their information related to EECS

- [ ] Given that a user has completed their profile and successfully indicated their interest in tutoring help, when another user attempts to locate them using the appropriate search criteria then that user should be able to find that profile and contact the user.

- [ ] Given that an instance of people advertising job opportunities exist on the database, when a user specifies that they want to see those offering job opportunities, then the profiles offering those opportunities shall be shown.

- [ ] Given that the user is looking for help, when they select the “tutor” option to be applied to their search, then the website should display only tutors who also meet whatever other input criteria they entered.

- [ ] Given that there are other users on the application, the main user can enter their weekly time availabilities, and other users who navigate to the main users profile, can see these times exactly as entered by the user

- [ ] Given that an expert has specific listed skills, when the user finds they are falsely advertising, then the user can report them.

- [ ] Given that, I have entered the specific language that I am using to build my project, I can now find experts to help with that. When I click the Search button after entering the specific language I need help with in the search box Then the experts are listed based on their level of experience with that language.

- [ ] Given that, I can see the list of students who are needing all the various types of help. When I click on a student’s individual request Then I can connect with and help the student using the messaging feature provided by the application.
