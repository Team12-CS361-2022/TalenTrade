This project is a student expert finder. Its goal is to help students or people in need of EECS skills connect with the students, and potentialy faculty, that have them.

Acceptance Tests -

- [x] Given that other users have made accounts on the database. When I search for OSU affiliated persons Then the software should filter my search results to all individuals within my search requirements who have tagged themselves as affiliated with Oregon State University.

- [ ] Given that there are other users to interact with. When I mark a users account as blocked Then the software will no longer forward any messages from their account to my email, and will display an error message to them instead.

- [ ] Given that the new user has visited the site for the first time, when they create their profile then that user should be able to enter in all their information related to EECS

- [x] Given that an instance of people advertising job opportunities exist on the database, when a user specifies that they want to see those offering job opportunities, then the profiles offering those opportunities shall be shown.

- [x] Given that the user is looking for a tutor, when they select the “tutor” option to be applied to their search, then the website should display only tutors who also meet whatever other input criteria they entered.

- [x] Given that, I have entered the specific language that I am using to build my project, I can now find experts to help with that. When I click the Search button after entering the specific language I need help with in the search box Then the experts are listed based on their level of experience with that language.

- [x] Given that the user is looking for users in need of help, when the user clicks on the “NeedHelp” tag to search for only those students, then all the student profiles in the database who are marked as in need of help will appear.
